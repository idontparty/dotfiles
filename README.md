# Toxic Tissue

Just me playing around with creative ways of installing dotfiles and doing host management.
- Currently focused around Arch based distros, in particular Endeavour OS. Support for other distros should not be too hard to implement though..

## How to do this
1. Install `oh-my-zsh` if relevant. (optional).
2. `bash install.sh` - this installs all the dotfiles and main repo packages.
